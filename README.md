# x86runner
Collectible trading card game with x86 Assembly Registers.

## How did you come up with the idea?
This past weekend I got together with a few friends to hack the binaries for the Defcon Quals. We ran the binary through qira and traced the execution. Unfortunately we were unable to crack it because we are all kind of n00bs at assembly. I created a first draft of these assembly cards as flash cards to run through and memorize the registers.

Now that I'm looking at the 49 cards it reminds me of the game Netrunner. There's a game in here waiting to be found. Any and all feedback is appreciated.

## Help Wanted
Please help me design these cards to look like NetRunner cards with type headers, bit lengths, capabilities, etc.

## Before and after comparison
First I'm showing the Assembly cards as they are with my limited graphic design skills. I'd like help designing the cards so they look like netrunner cards. I'd also like help coming up with a game mechanic that will teach how to use the registers.

## Full list of registers and pointers

I've created a list of all 49 cards in an excel document: [data.xlsx](https://github.com/davidkneely/x86runner/blob/master/spreadsheet/data.xlsx)
