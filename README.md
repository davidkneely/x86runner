# x86runner
Collectible trading card game with x86 Assembly Registers.

## How did you come up with the idea?
This past weekend I got together with a few friends to hack the binaries for the Defcon Quals. We ran the binary through qira and traced the execution. Unfortunately we were unable to crack the binary this weekend. I believe the one of the reasons we weren't able to extract the cipher is because we are all kind of n00bs at assembly. I created a first draft as flash cards to run through and memorize the registers.

## Help Wanted
Please help me design these cards to look like NetRunner cards with cost headers, types, capabilities, etc.

## Side by side comparison
First I'm showing the Assembly cards as they are with my limited graphic design skills. I'd like help designing the cards so they look like netrunner cards. I'd also like help coming up with a game mechanic that will teach how to use the registers.
